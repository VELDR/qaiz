## View It Live

When accessing Qaiz, you have two options:

### Option 1: [Vercel version](http://qaiz.fildabert.com)

Please note that the current deployment of Qaiz on Vercel's Hobby plan has certain limitations:

- Quizzes are limited to a maximum of 3 questions due to Vercel's serverless function execution timeout, which is set at 10 seconds.

- Occasionally, the platform may experience issues or delays in generating quizzes due to these limitations.

### Option 2: [My Domain](http://qaiz.fildabert.com)

If you wish to experience the website fully without vercel limitations, you can do so. However, since my domain uses HTTP, not HTTPS, I can understand that you would be cautious about logging in. Rest assured that that I do not collect any private data. But if this doesn't convince you, then you can view it via vercel.

Choose the option that suits you best!
